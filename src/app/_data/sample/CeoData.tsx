            Swetang Sinha has vast experience working in diverse roles that have exposed 
            him to different economic sectors thus giving him a competitive urge and unique 
            packaging as a business leader. His experience spans across ICT, Hospitality, Mining, 
            Trading, and the services sectors. This has placed him well for a consultancy role and 
            he has stepped up to the occasion through the establishment of Trayak to consult for 
            and help businesses build lasting and impactful brands in various economic spaces.

                I believe in the significance of small steps. The little things we all must do 
                while seeming insignificant, always are the much-needed building blocks required 
                to build an edifice. So, never undermine the little needed today to create the 
                big, desired tomorrow - Swetang Sinha

            Having worked as a business development executive at Pearson Education, Swetang has 
            horned his skill and art in the engineering of relevant business solutions for differing 
            markets. Pearson is an international media company with interests in education and 
            reputable imprints that feature Longman, and Merril Education, among others. He also 
            had the privilege of serving as Global Brand Manager for a United States Multinational, 
            Beckett Media.

            Swetang hails from a family of great values and inspiration. His father, Dr. Sujit 
            Sinha, is his principal source of human wisdom. He has remained his source of 
            encouragement in trying times through life and has always believed that wealth lies in
            people, a principle Swetang has also learnt to value and treasure.

                I have learnt to accept that pretty much every business is about people. Everyone 
                in business is in the business of people and to ignore this reality is to self-sabotage. 
                At Trayak, we help businesses learn people and align with people for sustainable mutual benefit -

            A statement that has almost become a cliche is that opportunities are hidden in problems. What you do is 
            informed by how you see. For Swetang, problems are the first sign of opportunity, and it is up to one to 
            choose to see the problem or the opportunity. Swetang's business philosophy and value proposition to his 
            clients lies in helping them see the opportunity within the problem and helping them create value out of it. 
            To Swetang's dictates, this value creation has got to be anchored in social empowerment of communities, otherwise 
            the business of promoting self-interest to the exclusion of people interest is no business at all.

            Our approach is different. Our approach draws from the philosophy propounded by Sir Richard Branson in his seminal book, 
            “Screw Business as usual.” There is immense opportunity to do business differently to empower communities - Swetang Sinha

            According to Swetang, the days of defending shareholder interest to the exclusion of other key stakeholders like 
            customers, and society at large are over for any serious and well-meaning business. Businesses have got to innovate 
            around win-win solutions which while giving them profit also empowers their communities and society at large.

            Swetang Sinha defines himself as a “transformative leader”. He holds the view that any leadership regime should 
            by extension be able to transform the lives of all its stakeholders in a positive way and set an example by improving 
            the people under its influence. Swetang has learnt the value of this leadership style first-hand from the eminent 
            Professor Dr. Kumra at IIM Lucknow. Swetang was impressed with this selfless leadership style and demonstrated how 
            it unlocks the best potentials in people.

            For Swetang, leadership is not a position but a role. He posits that leaders are a convenience of history, 
            needed to responsibly drive ahead society into a sustainable future. In his book, leadership equals responsibility 
            and therefore leaders ought to be accountable first to their conscience and then to the people they lead,
