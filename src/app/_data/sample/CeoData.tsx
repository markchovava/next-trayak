                I believe in the significance of small steps. The little things we all must do 
                while seeming insignificant, always are the much-needed building blocks required 
                to build an edifice. So, never undermine the little needed today to create the 
                big, desired tomorrow - Swetang Sinha

            Swetang hails from a family of great values and inspiration. His father, Dr. Sujit 
            Sinha, is his principal source of human wisdom. He has remained his source of 
            encouragement in trying times through life and has always believed that wealth lies in
            people, a principle Swetang has also learnt to value and treasure.

                I have learnt to accept that pretty much every business is about people. Everyone 
                in business is in the business of people and to ignore this reality is to self-sabotage. 
                At Trayak, we help businesses learn people and align with people for sustainable mutual benefit -
